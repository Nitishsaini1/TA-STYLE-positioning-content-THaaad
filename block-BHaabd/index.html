                    In our urban suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms, or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and places too numerous to mention,how useful they are!Ion our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still they are of great service.

                    How wonderfully patient is the cat when is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awating their egress from their places of refuge or that which is their home! How well shakespeare in Pericies, Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
